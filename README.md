# Databases

## The inventory

The `Inventory` database is the lowest layer, sustaining all others.
Its primary roles is to store the data about **Virtual Museums** (the contexts), **Partners** (the museums) and **Items** (the objects of the partners that are displayed in the Virtual Museums)

The Inventory does NOT store any information related to the business logic of individual applications.

The objective is to provide an unique and central repository, and API to maintain, and query the Inventory; providing the required basic features to any *museum* type of application. Such application will likely rely on the inventory, but will implement their own business logic.

## The applications

Different type of applications exist:

A **Museum**, is a Virtual Museum that presents all the *Items* and all the *Partners* defined in that Virtual Museum.

A **Gallery**, is a Virtual Museum that presents one collection of selected *Items*. Optionally offering a contextualized version of the items' metadata.

An **Exhibition**, is a Virtual Museum that presents one collection of selected *Images* (Images of an Item). Optionally offering a contextualized version of the images' metadata.

- **Museum** = **All items** and all partners of the Virtual Museum
- **Gallery** = **Selected items** and partners, chosen amongst the entire inventory, and presented in one specific context
- **Exhibition** = An extension of Gallery, where the only **selected images** are presented. Such images are optionally organized in *Themes*
